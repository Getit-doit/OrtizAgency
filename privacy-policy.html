      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span id="date"></span></p>

      <p>
        Ortiz Agency respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information you share with us.
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, disclosed, and safeguarded when you visit this
        website or contact us regarding insurance products and services.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect information that you voluntarily provide, such as your name, phone number, email address, mailing
        address, and other contact details. If you request a quote or insurance information, we may collect additional
        details necessary to evaluate coverage options and respond to your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect limited technical information automatically when you use the site, such as IP address,
        browser type, device identifiers, pages viewed, time spent on pages, referring/exit pages, and similar usage data.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies, Pixels, and Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We (and our service providers) may use cookies, web beacons/pixels, tags, and similar technologies to operate
        the site, remember preferences, measure performance, understand how visitors use the site, and support advertising
        and marketing efforts. You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect certain
        site functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>Marketing Automation and Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        We use marketing automation tools and services to help manage inquiries, route leads, schedule follow-ups, send
        communications, and measure marketing effectiveness. These tools may record when messages are sent, opened, or
        clicked, and may associate those events with an email address, phone number, or device identifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use advertising and analytics services that support interest-based advertising (sometimes called
        “remarketing”) to show ads to people who have visited our website. These services may rely on cookies or device
        identifiers to display ads and measure campaign performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be able to opt out of certain interest-based advertising through your device settings, browser settings,
        and/or industry opt-out mechanisms provided by advertising platforms. Availability of opt-out options can vary by
        browser, device, and provider.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use information to respond to inquiries, provide insurance quotes, service policies, communicate with you about
        your request, maintain records, and improve our services and website experience. We may also use information for
        fraud prevention, security, compliance, and other legitimate business purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>
        Ortiz Agency does not sell personal information for money. We may share information with insurance carriers,
        affiliated service providers, marketing/analytics vendors, and other third parties when necessary to provide
        requested services, operate our business, measure marketing performance, comply with legal obligations, or protect
        against fraud and unauthorized activity.
      </p>
